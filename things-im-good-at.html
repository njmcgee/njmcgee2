			<h1><a href="index.html">I'm Nathan McGinness</a></h1>
			<h2>I design and develop websites, logos, print work, animations and motion graphics.</h2>
		</div>		
		<div class="span-7" id="content">
			<h3>I'm an expert at designing, developing and deploying websites</h3>
			<p>Three years at a boutique digital studio saw me gain a passion for high quality design and web standards. The studio's small size allowed me to be involved in all aspects of production and project management.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Concept and art development, wireframes and UX design.</li>
				<li>Front-end development and templating. HTML, CSS &amp; JS.</li>
				<li>Proficient with PHP and SQL and associated content management systems i.e. Wordpress.</li>
				<li>Passionate about web typography</li>
			</ul>
			<hr/>
			<h3>I work extremely well with <a href="http://symphonycms.com">Symphony CMS</a></h3>
			<p>Content management systems are too often incredibly expensive and confusing. I believe in implementing simple and effective content management systems to suit <em>your</em> content and <em>your</em> technical ability.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Extremely efficient at templating with XML/XSLT.</li>
				<li>Developed and delivered successful small to mid-size content management systems for a wide range of clients handling a range of multimedia content.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr/>
			<h3>Project management and client communication</h3>
			<p>The breakdown of communication between designer and client can be cause of of many problems. I enjoy working directly with clients and have experience in pitching, project administration and most importantly, the celebratory glass of champagne at the end of a successful project.</p>
			<hr/>
			<h3>Logos and corporate identities</h3>
			<p>I have designed and delivered many successful logos for government, corporate and academic clients (see <a href="index.html#sisp-logo">SISP</a>, <a href="index.html#group-network">Group Network</a>, <a href="index.html#acccf">ACCCF</a> &amp; <a href="index.html#cde">CDE</a>). </p>
			<p>These have been among some of my most enjoyable projects particularly when paired with further identity work such as business cards, letterheads, style guides and multimedia templates.</p> 
			<hr/>
			<h3>Print based media</h3>
			<p>Publications, posters, brochures, banners, signage etc</p>
			<ul>
				<li>High level Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign skills</li>
				<li>A sound understanding of the print production process.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr/>
			<h3>Multimedia solutions</h3>
			<p>Presentations, interactives, video, motion graphics, CD-ROMs, DVDs, Flash.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Experience in developing, designing and installing touch-screen interactives (including the <a href="index.html#cricket">NMA's Cricket Journeys Interactive</a>). Flash, actionscript, hardware and installation.</li>
				<li>Developed animations for advertising, DVDs, award presentations and large scale, multi-screen presentations.</li>
				<li>Previous work includes promotional videos and animations for the National Arboretum and Gardens and visualising complex communication networks for the Australian Defence Force.</li>				
			</ul>
			<hr/>
			<h3>Copywriting</h3>
			<p>The web lends itself to honest, personal and concise communication, allowing you to target specific users and speak to them directly and accordingly. Fluffy marketing speak stands out and instantly feels expired.</p> 
			<p>Previous projects have also seen me develop copy for a wide range of clients in print publications, advertisements and other multimedia formats.</p>
			<hr/>
			<h3>Technical assistance</h3>
			<p>Contact me if you need assistance with your website, or you suspect there may be a better way to manage your everyday digital problems or workflow.</p>
			<hr/>
			<h3>Consultancy &amp; advice</h3>
			<p>You might be ready to embark on a large digital adventure, one too big for one man alone. You might benefit from advice or strategies from someone who has been through the process many times before. A few hours of affordable consultancy could send you into that big meeting equipped - knowing what you want, (what you don't) and how to ask for it.</p>

			<blockquote>&ldquo;We were sad to see him go: he's technically capable, has good design sense, and he's willing to take on challenges. He's also a great guy to work with: dedicated, deadline-aware, and good with clients.
